# Rclone

Rclone is a command line program to sync files and directories to and from
various cloud storage services, including Google Drive, Amazon S3, Dropbox,
Microsoft OneDrive, Yandex Disk and many others.

This has not been tested with the new repo layout.

The original pi-timolo repo had the rclone install as part of the main
installation and there was also an `rclone-instal.sh`. The oringal pi-timolo
install is preserved in this folder as`RCLONE-pi-timolo-install.sh`.

The `rclone-install.sh` should be refactored. A depedencies installer should also
be created.

The rclone-samples folder is a collection of rclone config files for various
cloud storage services.
